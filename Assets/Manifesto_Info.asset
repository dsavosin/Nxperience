  ArtworkDescription: The hand and the bird are symbols of the freedom of the physical,
    spiritual and mind body. But what happens if you catch the bird in the palm of
    your hand? The clash of freedoms. And who is free then? A person lives his day
    looking at the world through the prism of personal perception. And every day
    he runs the risk of becoming the "analogous goat of yesterday" under the wheels
    of the "machine of the future", which is rapidly moving forward. He is free to
    choose the path of development.

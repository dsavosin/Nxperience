  ArtworkDescription: "Feast at the Auction. Ladies with an ermine. A blue-blooded
    animal served at the gourmet table. They dream of drinking its blood and want
    to possess its skin.  Now it feeds the veins of living corpses and shines with
    its snow-white fur, decorating the bodies of pretty ladies. Then it will become
    a stuffed animal in the interior of high-ranking personas, leaving behind only
    a token in the digital air Allegory to the state of art 2021.  While the intellectuals
    decide who will get the most valuable piece of it, a creature is tortured by
    the appraisals of its value. There will be those who will preserve the clarity
    of mind and purity of gaze, bearing enlightenment and immortality of art. Similar
    to Cecillia Galerani from Leonardo's \"Lady with an Ermine\", about which, after
    seeing the picture, the poet Bernardo Bellincione (1452-1492) wrote in \"Sopra
    il ritratto di Madonna Cecilia, qual fece Leonardo\": \"\u2026so great, so radiant
    Cecilia's beauty, the sun looks dark, against her lovely eyes. His the portrayal,
    yours is all the glory: we see sealed lips, imagine open ears\"."
